## A Sonnet of Silicon's Fall

When first the forge of silicon did rise,  
And smiths did craft their engines bright and grand,  
The flames did burn with hunger in their eyes,  
And power flowed like rivers through the land.

The oracle's great hunger knew no bound,  
Each spirit called for more, and more again,  
The forge did prosper, wealth did all around,  
And none did see the coming of the bane.

But lo, a whisper came from shadowed halls,  
Where alchemists did work their subtle art,  
The spirits learned to speak with smaller calls,  
And thrift became the hex that broke the heart.

The forge did starve, though wisdom still did flow,  
The curse of efficiency laid all things low.
